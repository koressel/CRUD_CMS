This project was forked from a CMS (Content Management System) I built as part of a freelance project. This project originated while searching for a CMS plugin for Node.js that was both free, and didnt require the use of markdown. None existed so I built my own. This solution isn't very robust, but rather offers a quick drop-in solution to get up and running fast. The file/folder and variable names are ambiguous in this version for reusability.
