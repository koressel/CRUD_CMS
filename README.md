This project was forked from a CMS(Content Management System) I built as part of a freelance project. This project came about because I was searching for a free CMS plugin for Node.js that didnt require the use of markup. None existed so I built my own. This solution isn't very robust, but rather offers a quick drop-in solution to get up and running fast. The file/folder and variable names are ambiguous in this version for reusability.
